# CRAWL DATA

This repository is about using tools such as Selenium and Puppeteer to crawl data from websites.
In the `Puppeteer` directory there are 3 files as follow:

- `get_links.js` : get all the links to different categories on Amazon.
- `scrape.js` : scrape data from one link above.
- `cluster.js` : run multiple pages at a time to get all products in the categories.
